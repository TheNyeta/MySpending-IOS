# MySpending-IOS

My first time learning mobile app developement in IOS with Xcode and this is my first project on IOS.
Its almost the same with MySpending, but on ios with some small change.

There is an image that will show the category you choose.
Also in the setting, there is an option to toggle show total in which the application will show the total of all the spendings.
